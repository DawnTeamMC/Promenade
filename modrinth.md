Promenade is a mod for the latest version of Minecraft that adds a ton of features to the game related to exploration, diversity and will improve the beauty of you world.

**You can visit the [official website for Promenade for more information](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade).**

## üëæ Features
### Biomes
**Due to a missing Fabric API module, Promenade v2.5.0 and higher versions require [TerraBlender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender-fabric) to be installed for overworld biomes to appear in your world.**

The biggest feature of Promenade is the [cherry oak forest](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/biomes#cherry-oak-forests), a sweet and charming biome that comes in 2 variants (pink/white).  
Blossoming with cherry trees, this calm realm is perfect for japanese-style buildings and even features a brand new wood type: [the cherry wood](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/blocks#cherry-oak-wood).

Picked up from Minecraft: Dungeons, the [pumpkin pasture](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/biomes#pumpkin-pastures) feature autumnal trees.  
This warm place is home to thousands of bees and bring up a unique orange-yellow color palette to your world. This is also probably one of the best places to watch the sun set.

Promenade also adds a [new palm wood type](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/blocks#palm-wood) that can be obtained from [palms](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/biomes#palms) located in the deserts of Minecraft.

![](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/images/screenshots/tritanopian_gallery.png)
The Nether got new [galleries](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/biomes#nether-galleries) to replace with most of the barren nether wastes.  
Nether galleries feature mushrooms in 3 different variants that reflect some types of color blindness: protanopia, achromatopsia and tritanopia.

You may also find [taller Nether forests](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/biomes#taller-nether-forests) for more dramatic landscapes and darker areas at the ground level.

Barren places are also prominent in the ender. That's why you will encounter the new [dark amaranth forests](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/biomes#dark-amaranth-forests).  
Watch out for the spiders, who like to climb up the purple fungi of this gloomy forest. 

### Structures
![](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/images/screenshots/witch_hut.png)
[Witch huts](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/structures#witch-huts) can be found in dark forests.

### Animals
![](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/images/screenshots/ducks.png)
The [ducks](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/animals#ducks) are gentle animals that can be found in any biome that features pigs, cows, chicken and sheep.  
They are able to swim fast and to float on water. You can feed and breed ducks with seeds (not bread, that is bad for their digestion!).

### Monsters
![](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/images/screenshots/sunken_skeletons.png)
Straight from Minecraft: Dungeons, [sunken skeletons](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/monsters#sunken-skeletons) are foes that live in warm oceans.  
You can collect the undead coral they wear by overcoming the danger of their crossbows and killing them underwater.

![](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/images/screenshots/lush_creepers.png)
[Lush Creepers](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/monsters#lush-creepers) can be rarely found in caves, and will leave blocks found in lush caves upon explosion.

### Other
- New igneous rocks have been added underground (known as [blunite and carbonite](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/blocks#blunite-and-carbonite))
- [Blueberry bushes](https://dawnteammc.github.io/promenade/blocks#blueberry-bushes) can be found in cold biomes.
