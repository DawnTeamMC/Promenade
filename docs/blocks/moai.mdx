Inspired by the real-life Moai statues of Easter Island, the **moai** is a decorative block.

## Obtaining

The moai can be cut from a tuff block through the use of a stonecutter.
The moai can be oriented horizontally and can be made taller by stacking one above or below another in the same direction.

You can also wear a moai on your head. Fabulous. ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿
