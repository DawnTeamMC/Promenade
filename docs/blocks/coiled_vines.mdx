Coiled vines are plants that can attach to solid surfaces, in any direction. They grow block by block.

## Obtaining

Coiled vines generate naturally in [dark amaranth forests](../biomes/dark_amaranth_forest).
They are found there growing in any horizontal direction.

You can grow any planted coiled vine using bone meal.

## Usage

Coiled vines can be trimmed with shears at the tip to prevent them from growing further.

They can be climbed by players, but if they are horizontal you'll most likely be slowed down by them.
