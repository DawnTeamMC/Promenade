Snowy leaves are simple variants of leaves that are covered in snow.

## Obtaining

Snowy leaves can be naturally found in snowy biomes, such as [glacarian taigas](../biomes/glacarian_taiga).

A snowy leaves block will appear when snow layers are stacked on top of leaves blocks.

Other snowy leaves can be crafted by combining a leaf block with a snow layer on top in a crafting table.

## Drops

All snowy leaves drop the same as their non-snowy variant when broken, with the addition of snowballs.
