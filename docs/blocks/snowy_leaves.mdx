Snowy leaves are simple variants of leaves that are covered in snow.

## Obtaining

Spruce snowy leaves can be naturally found in [glacarian taigas](../biomes/glacarian_taiga).

Other snowy leaves can be crafted by combining a leaf block with a snow layer on top in a crafting table.

## Drops

All snowy leaves drop the same as their non-snowy variant when broken, with the addition of snowballs.
