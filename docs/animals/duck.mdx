The **duck** is a passive animal. Ducks are known for their quacking and waddling.

## Spawning

Ducks spawn in most grassy biomes in groups, just like cows, pigs, chicken, and sheep.

<Callout>
    You can tweak the frequency of the animals in the [mod's configuration file](../customization/configuration).
</Callout>

## Variants

The baby ducks are **ducklings** and feature a yellow color.

Ducks spawning in rivers and ocean will be **mallards**.

## Behavior

Ducks are very similar to chicken, but can swim in water. They're also fed the same way (seed items).

<Callout variant="warning">
    Contrary to popular belief, bread is not a good food for ducks. It can cause malnutrition and other health problems.
    (In our real world)

## Drops

When killed, adult ducks drop raw duck meat and feathers. Raw duck can be cooked.
