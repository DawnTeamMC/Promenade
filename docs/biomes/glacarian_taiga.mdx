The **glacarian taiga** is the coldest biome you will find. It is a snowy forest inspired by the look of snowy siberian taigas.

<Asset width={1024} location="promenade:biome/glacarian_taiga" title="Glacaian Taiga"/>

## Description

Covered by a thick layer of three snow blocks, the glacarian taiga can be dangerous to unprepared adventurers.
During snowy weather, it starts freezing all entities that are not protected from the cold. (see below for details)
Water is also frozen, up to multiple layers of packed ice/regular ice deep.

This is the only biome where snowy spruce trees naturally generate.
These trees' leaves drop spruce saplings, which won't grow into snowy trees.
This makes this biome's trees effectively unique. <Asset width={32} location="promenade:snowy_spruce_leaves" title="Snowy Spruce Leaves"/>

## Generation
It generates in the Overworld as frequently as a snowy forest.

<Callout>
    You can tweak the frequency of the biomes in the [mod's configuration file](../customization/configuration).

You can find wolves, foxes and ducks in this biome.

## Freezing snowfalls
Entities must meet one of the following conditions in order to not freeze under snowfalls:
- Is close to a source of light OR is buried enough in the ground (*minimum level 5 of block light level OR maximum level 5 of sky-light level*)
- Wears a piece of leather armor

The freezing effect is similar to the one of the powdered snow block, and is as lethal.

Some mobs are unaffected by the cold, like ducks, snow golems, strays, polar bears, creakings, withers, and ender dragons.

    You can edit the list of biomes in which this effect occur and the entities affected by it. See the [configuration page](../customization/configuration#freezing-snowfalls-configuration) for more details.
