The **sunken** is an aquatic monster.
They are rumored to be the remains of drowned sailors, who were cursed to hold onto life in this form thanks to the health of coral reefs.

## Spawning

Sunkens can be found in warm and lukewarm oceans in groups of 1 to 3.

<Callout>
    You can tweak the frequency of the animals in the [mod's configuration file](../customization/configuration).

## Variants

<Asset width={1024} location="promenade:entity/sunken_variants" title="Sunken variants"/>

For every type of vanilla coral, there is a sunken variant.

## Behavior

Sunkens are armed with crossbows, and they are naturally hostile to players and dolphins.

They are also preys of axolotls.

## Drops

A sunken will drop the usual skeleton drops, but will also drop an additional coral item.

This coral depends on the type of the sunken, and **if the sunken is killed outside of water, the coral item will be dead**.
