The **lush creeper** is a plant-like monster.
It is rumored that creepers on the verge of death can be saved by the lively nature of the lush caves, turning them into lush creepers.

## Spawning

Lush creepers can be found in lush caves, and they are naturally hostile to players.

## Behavior

Just like regular creepers, lush creepers will explode when they are close to a player.
However, if the ground is ready for it, the lush creeper will plant lush decorations around the area instead of dealing damage when exploding:
