The configuration file for Promenade can be found at `.minecraft/config/promenade.json`.
This file is used to tweak values of mod features. This is not meant to add new features or drastically change the mod's behavior.

## How to change the configuration

Open the file using a text editor of your choice. Here's the default configuration values:

```json
{
    "biomes": {
        "carnelian_treeway_weight": 20,
        "sakura_groves_weight": 20,
        "glacarian_taiga_weight": 10,
        "dark_amaranth_forests_noise": {
            "erosion": 0.0,
            "depth": 0.0,
            "weirdness": 0.0,
            "offset": 0.0,
            "temperature": 0.15,
            "humidity": -0.3,
            "continentalness": 0.0
        }
    },
    "world_features": {
        "igneous_rock_patches": true,
        "blueberry_bushes": true,
        "palms": true
    },
    "animals": {
        "capybaras_weight": 10,
        "ducks_weight": 10
    },
    "monsters": {
        "lush_creepers_weight": 10,
        "sunkens_weight": 10
    }
}
```

To increase or decrease the frequency of a weighted feature, change its weight. Setting it to 0 or below will prevent the feature from ever appearing.

<Callout variant="info">
    If you are a server owner or a modpack creator, you might want to let know players of disabled features in the first place. This will prevent them from researching why they can't said features for too long.
    For example, disabling a biome will not remove the related blocks (i.e. the wood set) from the game, but they will never appear naturally in the world.
    The blocks will still be visible to players using recipe viewing mods and such.
