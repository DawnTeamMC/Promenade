## Game rules

Promenade adds 1 game rule to the game:
- `doBlocksGetSnowy`
  - **Description**: If set to `true`, some blocks may naturally turn into snowy variants when snow layers are placed on top of them. Currently, this only affects [leaves blocks](../blocks/snowy_leaves).
  - **Type**: `boolean` (`true` or `false`)
  - **Default**: `true`

## Configuration file

The configuration file for Promenade can be found at `.minecraft/config/promenade.json`.
This file is used to **tweak values of the mod's features**. This is not meant to add new features or drastically change the mod's behavior.

### Change the configuration

Open the file using a text editor of your choice. Here's the default configuration values:

```json
{
    "biomes": {
        "carnelian_treeway_weight": 20,
        "sakura_groves_weight": 20,
        "glacarian_taiga_weight": 10,
        "dark_amaranth_forests_noise": {
            "erosion": 0.0,
            "depth": 0.0,
            "weirdness": 0.0,
            "offset": 0.0,
            "temperature": 0.15,
            "humidity": -0.3,
            "continentalness": 0.0
        }
    },
    "world_features": {
        "igneous_rock_patches": true,
        "blueberry_bushes": true,
        "palms": true
    },
    "animals": {
        "capybaras_weight": 10,
        "ducks_weight": 10
    },
    "monsters": {
        "lush_creepers_weight": 10,
        "sunkens_weight": 10
    }
}
```

To increase or decrease the frequency of a weighted feature, change its weight. **Setting it to 0 or below will prevent the feature from ever appearing.**

<Callout variant="warning">
    You must restart the server (or your client) for the changes to take effect.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info">
    If you are a server owner or a modpack creator, you might want to let players know of disabled features in the first
    place.
    This will prevent them from researching why they can't find features for too long.
    For example, disabling a biome will not remove the related blocks (i.e. the wood set) from the game, but they will never appear naturally in the world.
    The blocks will still be visible to players using recipe viewing mods and such.
</Callout>

## Freezing snowfalls configuration
The [glacarian taiga biome](../biomes/glacarian_taiga) features freezing snowfalls. Entities that are not protected from the cold will freeze to death during snowfalls.
The `#promenade:can_freeze_during_snowfall` biome tag controls the list of biomes that can freeze entities to death during snowfall.
This means that you can add or remove biomes from this list, including the glacarian taiga biome itself and modded biomes by appending the tag using a data pack.

The list of entities immune to freezing is controlled by the `#minecraft:freeze_immune_entity_types` entity type tag.
