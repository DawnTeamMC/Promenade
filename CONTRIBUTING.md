### Getting started for code modification
We're excited to hear that you're interested in contributing to Promenade!

Before getting started, you'll need to install the latest 64-bit version of the OpenJDK 8 for your environment.
- Windows users: We **strongly** recommend you use the Hotspot OpenJDK 8 builds provided by the [AdoptOpenJDK project](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) instead of the builds provided by Oracle.
- macOS and Linux users: If you are already using a package manager, OpenJDK builds should be present in your software repositories. If not, we recommend using [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/) to install the Hotspot OpenJDK 8 builds provided by the [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) project.

We strongly recommend you use [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) when making code contributions. While other IDEs may work (in theory, anyway), you will often run into issues and other roadblocks. If you're not familiar with setting up IntelliJ IDEA for use with Fabric projects, the community of Fabric has created a wiki which runs over a lot of the basics of Fabric [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/doku.php).

If you have any questions or issues, or would just like to discuss Promenade development, feel free to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/8ksTVJu).
